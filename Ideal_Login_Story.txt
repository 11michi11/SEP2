when login is clicked view manager must call method in controller that someone wnats to login, 

controller creates authentication object and pass it to client proxy

client proxy sends this to server proxy

server proxy passes authentication object to server controller

server controller calls authentication method in model manager

model manager checks the list of users and return login status alongside with usertype

server controller asks model manager for post

model manager gets latest post from model and returns it to controller


/*
model manager asks database adapter for desired login and pasword from database and then manager compares this and returns login status to server controller

server controller does some action according the status 

in this case controller asks model manager for latest post object

model manager accesses database to get info about the latest post and return post object that returns to controller
*/



server controller creates login object passes it to server proxy to send it to client proxy

client proxy receives data and passses login object to controller 

client controller calls client model manager to save this login object into client model
